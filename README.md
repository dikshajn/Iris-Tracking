    The provided code utilizes <b>OpenCV</b> to perform <b>iris tracking</b> in a live webcam stream. It starts by detecting faces using a pre-trained <b>Haar cascade classifier</b>. Within each detected <b>face region</b>, the code identifies <b>eyes</b> using another <b>Haar cascade classifier</b>. For each detected <b>eye</b>, further processing is performed to locate and track the <b>iris</b>. This could involve techniques like <b>thresholding</b>, <b>edge detection</b>, and <b>contour analysis</b>, though these specific methods are not implemented in the provided code and are left as placeholders. Once the iris is tracked within each eye region, <b>rectangles</b> are drawn around the detected eyes and faces for visualization. The program continuously processes frames from the webcam, updating the displayed video stream in real-time. Pressing the '<b>q</b>' key exits the program. Overall, the code provides a basic framework for iris tracking, but additional processing steps are needed to accurately track the iris within the eye regions.
